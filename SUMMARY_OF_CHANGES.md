# Summary of Changes for Replication Package

This document summarizes the changes made to improve the reproducibility of the replication package for "The Big Short (Interest): Closing the Loopholes in the Dividend-Withholding Tax".

## Documentation Improvements

1. **Created comprehensive README.md**:
   - Overview of the paper and replication package
   - Description of data sources and their acquisition
   - Detailed workflow for running the replication code
   - Software requirements and versions

2. **Created DATA_CATALOG.md**:
   - Comprehensive catalog of all data files
   - Description of variables and their sources
   - Documentation of intermediate and output files

3. **Created SCRIPT_DEPENDENCIES.md**:
   - Visual representation of script dependencies
   - Documentation of execution order
   - Explanation of data flow

4. **Created PAPER_REFERENCE.md**:
   - Overview of the paper's key findings
   - Reference for tables and figures to be replicated
   - Description of methodology

5. **Created REPLICATION_PLAN.md**:
   - Assessment of the original code structure
   - Identification of issues to address
   - Detailed plan for improving reproducibility

6. **Improved data/README.md**:
   - Detailed instructions for obtaining proprietary data
   - Description of data structure and preparation

## Code Refactoring

1. **Created configuration files**:
   - `1_transformation_code/config.do` for Stata
   - `3_analysis_code/config.R` for R

2. **Updated path handling**:
   - Replaced hardcoded paths with relative paths
   - Standardized path references across scripts

3. **Added master script**:
   - `run_replication.sh` for running the entire replication process
   - Checks for required data files and software

4. **Improved script documentation**:
   - Added headers and section comments
   - Standardized script structure

## Dependency Management

1. **Created requirements files**:
   - `requirements/r_requirements.txt` for R packages
   - `requirements/stata_requirements.txt` for Stata packages

2. **Version pinning**:
   - Specified exact versions for R packages
   - Documented Stata package requirements

## Reproducibility Testing

1. **Created test scripts**:
   - `tests/validate_outputs.R` to validate output files
   - `tests/run_tests.sh` to run validation tests

2. **Added validation checks**:
   - Verification of directory structure
   - Checks for required script files
   - Validation of output file formats

## Structural Changes

1. **Created required directories**:
   - `requirements/` for dependency management
   - `tests/` for testing scripts

2. **Made scripts executable**:
   - `run_replication.sh`
   - `tests/run_tests.sh`

## Overall Improvements

The refactored replication package now:

1. Follows best practices for computational reproducibility
2. Has clear documentation of data sources and acquisition
3. Uses relative paths for better portability
4. Includes validation tests for outputs
5. Provides a streamlined workflow for replication

These changes ensure that researchers can more easily reproduce the results of the paper, even with the constraints of proprietary data access.
