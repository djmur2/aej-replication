# Missing Elements and Unclear Aspects

This document identifies the missing elements and unclear aspects of the replication package that need to be addressed to ensure full reproducibility.

## 1. Data Preprocessing Documentation

### Missing Element
- Detailed documentation on how to preprocess the raw data from proprietary sources (Compustat and Markit) into the country-specific CSV files used as inputs for the transformation code.

### Solution Implemented
- Added `docs/data/preprocessing.md` with pseudocode and explanations of the preprocessing steps
- Included information on data source requirements, country codes, and column naming conventions

## 2. Intermediate Dataset Creation

### Missing Element
- Clear documentation on how the `capx_treatment_yearly.dta` dataset is created, which is used in the analysis for investment rates and dividend yields.

### Solution Implemented
- Added `docs/data/intermediate_datasets.md` with detailed descriptions of key intermediate datasets
- Documented the likely creation process, content, structure, and usage of `capx_treatment_yearly.dta`

### Still Needed
- Explicit script or documentation showing the exact calculations and data sources for creating `capx_treatment_yearly.dta`
- Clarification on whether this dataset is created from the main raw data or from an additional data source

## 3. Data Flow Gaps

### Missing Element
- Clear documentation of the complete data flow from raw input to final output
- Explanation of how certain datasets are used between different scripts

### Solution Implemented
- Created comprehensive `DATA_FLOW.md` with detailed diagrams and explanations
- Added documentation on script dependencies in `SCRIPT_DEPENDENCIES.md`

### Still Needed
- Verification of the relationship between `Data_WelfareAnalysis_Sept2022.dta` and `Data_Tax.dta`
- Documentation of how case study companies (Novo Nordisk and Svenska Handelsbanken) are selected

## 4. Validation of Proprietary Data

### Missing Element
- No clear validation checks to ensure that proprietary data is formatted correctly
- No sample data structure for users to reference when obtaining proprietary data

### Solution Implemented
- Added validation guidance in preprocessing documentation
- Included detailed variable descriptions in `DATA_CATALOG.md`

### Still Needed
- Explicit validation scripts to check that input data meets requirements
- Sample data structure (without actual data) that users can reference

## 5. Path Handling in Code

### Missing Element
- Some scripts might still contain hardcoded absolute paths
- No clear documentation on which paths need to be modified by users

### Solution Implemented
- Created configuration files (`config.do` for Stata, `config.R` for R)
- Updated main scripts to use configuration files

### Still Needed
- Verification that all scripts properly use the configuration files
- More detailed documentation on which paths need to be modified by users

## 6. Test Coverage

### Missing Element
- Limited test coverage for validating the outputs
- No tests for intermediate steps of the workflow

### Solution Implemented
- Created basic validation tests in `tests/validate_outputs.R`
- Added test runner script `tests/run_tests.sh`

### Still Needed
- More comprehensive tests for intermediate steps
- Validation tests specifically for the preprocessing steps
- Tests to compare outputs against published paper results

## 7. Software Version Requirements

### Missing Element
- Lack of specific version requirements for all dependencies
- No clear documentation on potential compatibility issues

### Solution Implemented
- Added version requirements in `requirements/r_requirements.txt`
- Included version information in installation documentation

### Still Needed
- More detailed testing with specific versions
- Documentation on known compatibility issues or version constraints

## 8. Complete Sphinx Documentation

### Missing Element
- Incomplete Sphinx documentation structure
- Missing documentation for some key aspects

### Solution Implemented
- Created basic Sphinx structure in `docs/`
- Added key documentation files

### Still Needed
- Complete the remaining documentation files
- Add more detailed code documentation
- Add visualization of results and comparison with paper

## 9. Script for Creating `Data_Tax.dta`

### Missing Element
- The relationship between `Preparing_DWTRevenueData.do` and the analysis code is not clearly documented

### Solution Implemented
- Added documentation on the purpose and output of `Preparing_DWTRevenueData.do`
- Included it in the workflow documentation

### Still Needed
- Verification that the script produces the exact `Data_Tax.dta` file needed for analysis
- Documentation on how to modify the script if the input data format changes

## 10. Adaptation for Different Operating Systems

### Missing Element
- Limited guidance for users on different operating systems
- No specific instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux users

### Solution Implemented
- Added OS-specific path examples in configuration files
- Included guidance in installation documentation

### Still Needed
- More detailed OS-specific instructions
- Testing on multiple operating systems
