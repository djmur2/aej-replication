## Abstract

This paper studies how closing loopholes in dividend withholding taxation affects financial markets. We analyze a reform in Denmark that reduced opportunities for dividend tax arbitrage. Using a unique dataset on stock lending around ex-dividend dates, we show that before the reform, German, French, and US stocks exhibit high short interest around ex-dividend dates, while Danish stocks exhibit even higher short interest. We explain this pattern through a tax-avoidance mechanism. When Denmark strengthened enforcement to close this loophole, stock lending decreased for Danish stocks only. The reform increased dividend tax revenues by 75% without negative effects on stock returns, liquidity, or investment.

## Key Findings

1. Before the reform, Danish stocks exhibited abnormally high short interest around ex-dividend dates
2. After the reform, stock lending decreased significantly for Danish stocks only
3. The reform increased dividend tax revenues by approximately 75%
4. No negative effects were observed on stock returns, liquidity, or investment

## Data Sources

The analysis relies on three main data sources:

1. **Compustat Global:** Financial and stock market data for European companies
2. **Markit Securities Finance:** Data on stock lending, including short interest and utilization rates
3. **National Tax Authorities:** Dividend withholding tax revenue data for Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden

## Methodology

The paper employs various econometric methods:

1. **Event study analysis:** To examine stock lending patterns around ex-dividend dates
2. **Difference-in-differences:** To estimate the causal effect of the reform on various outcomes
3. **Synthetic control:** To estimate the effect on tax revenue using other Nordic countries as controls

## Main Contribution

This paper provides empirical evidence that closing tax loopholes can generate substantial revenue without negative effects on financial markets or the real economy. It demonstrates how stock lending markets are used for dividend tax arbitrage and how policy changes can effectively address this issue.
